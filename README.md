Widgets I've created to improve the efficiency, output, and overall happiness of myself, my team, and those I trust at work.

Widget will go near-invisible when the mouse is not on it.

## Behaviors

## Looping
When "START LOOP" has been pressed, the loop will be active and the button will then say "STOP LOOP."
### Loop countdown
When the loop is active, it will trigger a countdown once conditions are met. The countdown will do an initial high pitched beep, then medium pitched beeps every second until the timer ends (default 3 seconds). Once the timer ends, a low pitched beep will sound and the ASM Next Call will be triggered. 

These are the conditions that will trigger a countdown:
- Agent Call: Dialing has lasted longer than 35 seconds
- Agent Call: Live Call has connected
  
### Stopping the loop countdown
The loop countdown can be stopped in two ways:
1. Pressing the "STOP LOOP" button
2. Hovering back over the widget after originally hovering off of it

# Tab / Toast Killer Widget

This widget keeps the tab count under 10 and removes the annoying toast notifications. It can mass kill or run a continous loop.
