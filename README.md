Defffinitely not injecting these scripts into the console at my work. Why would I ever do that?

Security concerns? No worries, it's all just loops and native clicks. Salesforce blocks me from sending or receiving anything outside of the web app, anyways.

Besides, I'm going to lose my mind clicking the same 4 buttons every 15 seconds. You know how many clicks in an 8 hour shift that is? 1,920. No. Just. No.
