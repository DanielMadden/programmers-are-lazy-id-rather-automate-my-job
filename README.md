Defffinitely not injecting these scripts into the console at my work. Why would I ever do that?
Security concerns? No worries, it's all just loops and native clicks. Salesforce blocks me from sending or receiving anything outside of the web app, anyways.
Besides, I'm going to lose my mind clicking the same 4 buttons every 15 seconds. You know how many clicks in an 8 hour shift that is? 1,920. No. Just. No.
I know I'm a programmer. I should probably just stay in my tech career. Could program. Could design. Could manage projects. Could manage people.
But god, the tech industry is SUCHHH a drag. Everyone's so professional and fake nice. WHERE IS THE HUMANITY??? I love my job. We talk mad sh*t here. We have fun. We joke around. We laugh. That's real. The money ain't much, but the culture here is peak.
So yeah, I'm going to stay at my call center job for now and yes I'm going to keep programming and optimizing everything in my life, including the UX/UI workflow of our application and I'm going to program it as well.
The one sad thing about all of this... I can't share it with anyone at work. The UX/UI innovator in me wants to share it with everyone and make everyone's lives easier! But this world is full of fear. People fear what they don't understand. And the ignorant? The ignorant would see this as a threat. Would see this as a breach in security--even IT. They wouldn't be able to read the code and see that all I'm doing is triggering page clicks.

Thus I am cursed to keep this blessing to myself.
