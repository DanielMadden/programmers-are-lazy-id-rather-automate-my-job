# Work Widgets

Widgets I've created to improve the efficiency, output, and overall happiness of myself, my team, and those I trust at work.

### Behaviors

### Loop Interactions
#### Loop countdown
When "START LOOP" has been pressed, the loop will be active and the button will then say "STOP LOOP."
When the loop is active, it will trigger a countdown in these cases:
- Agent Call: Dialing has lasted longer than 35 seconds
- Agent Call: Live Call has connected
  
#### Stopping the loop countdown
The loop countdown can be stopped in two ways:
1. Pressing the "STOP LOOP" button
2. Hovering back over the widget after originally hovering off of it
